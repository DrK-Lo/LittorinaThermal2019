# KEL, MAA & FT Meeting 11/17/2020

During this meeting, we checked the original mixed-effects model as written in LittorinaStatistics.Rmd (assigned to "mort1") to ensure that it included the relevant effects and then tried running the model on the data; however, the model failed to converge. We also tried manipulating the maximum number of function evaluations and the tolerance of the model, but it again failed to converge. The model still failed to converge after incrementally removing terms from the model, and it ultimately worked with _only_ Block included as a random effect.

Given these outcomes, we decided to try restructuring the data such that there would be one line per individual (to avoid including multiple measures on an individual, and thereby remove the need to include the random effect of SampleID) and to then run a new model on this restructured data.
