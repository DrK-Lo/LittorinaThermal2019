# KEL & FT Meeting 11/04/2020

After discussing realistic goals and a timeline for the remainder of the semester, we went through the Methods section of the manuscript to discuss recent edits and additional necessary changes/additions. 

Changes and additions discussed included:
- Creating a figure to show temperature data over time for the two study locations
- Adding standard error values where relevant (e.g. for mean treatment temperatures)
- Citing the shell measurement description from Gouveia 2011 and adding an appropriate shell schematic diagram (*Katie will draw using vector art)
- Combining the acclimation/exposure/recovery timeline figures into a single figure
